# Caesar Cipher

A simple Python CLI tool to encrypt and decrypt messages using the classic Caesar cipher technique.

## What is a Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. It is one of the oldest known ciphers and is named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to protect his messages.

## Features

- Encrypt and decrypt messages with a custom shift value
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Leaves non-alphabetic characters unchanged
- Simple and intuitive command-line interface

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/night-owl-official/CaesarCypher_CLI.git
    cd CaesarCypher_CLI
    ```

2. **Run the program:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. **Follow the prompts to encrypt or decrypt your message.**

## Example

```
Type 'encrypt (e)' to encrypt, type 'decrypt (d)' to decrypt:
e
Type your message:
Hello, World!
Type the shift number:
5
Encrypted Text: Mjqqt, Btwqi!
```
